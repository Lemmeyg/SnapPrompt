# SnapPrompt User Guide

SnapPrompt is a Chrome extension that allows you to save and quickly insert text snippets into any text field on the web.

## Features

*   **Save up to 5 text snippets:** Store your most frequently used text, such as greetings, signatures, or common replies.
*   **Easy access:** Insert snippets using the right-click context menu or keyboard shortcuts.
*   **Simple configuration:** Add, edit, and delete snippets through a user-friendly popup interface.

## How to Use

### 1. Adding a Snippet

1.  Click the SnapPrompt icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the configuration popup.
2.  In the "Label" field, enter a short, descriptive name for your snippet (e.g., "Greeting," "My Email").
3.  In the "Prompt Text" field, enter the full text of your snippet.
4.  Click "Store Prompt" to save the snippet.

### 2. Inserting a Snippet

You can insert your saved snippets in two ways:

*   **Right-click:** Right-click in any text field (e.g., a text box on a website, an email composition window) and select your desired snippet from the SnapPrompt context menu.
*   **Keyboard shortcuts:** Use the following keyboard shortcuts to insert your snippets in any Chrome tab or web page:
    *   `Ctrl+Shift+1`: Insert the first snippet.
    *   `Ctrl+Shift+2`: Insert the second snippet.
    *   `Ctrl+Shift+3`: Insert the third snippet.
    *   `Ctrl+Shift+4`: Insert the fourth snippet.

    **Note:** These shortcuts only work within the Chrome browser. To use snippets in other applications (Word, Notepad, etc.), click the copy button (📋) next to any snippet to copy it to your clipboard, then paste it wherever needed.

#### Customizing Keyboard Shortcuts

You can customize the keyboard shortcuts or add shortcuts for additional snippets (up to 10 total):

1.  Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
2.  Click the menu icon (☰) in the top-left corner
3.  Select "Keyboard shortcuts"
4.  Find "SnapPrompt" in the list
5.  Click in the shortcut field next to any snippet command
6.  Press your desired key combination (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+5` for snippet 5)
7.  Repeat for any additional snippets you want to assign shortcuts to

**Important Notes:**
- Chrome extensions are limited to 4 pre-configured shortcuts, but you can manually add shortcuts for all 10 snippets through the Chrome extensions settings.
- We recommend using `Ctrl+Shift+[number]` combinations to avoid conflicts with browser shortcuts.
- All keyboard shortcuts only work within Chrome browser tabs and windows. They cannot insert text into desktop applications.

### 3. Managing Snippets

*   **Deleting a snippet:** Open the SnapPrompt popup, find the snippet you want to remove, and click the "X" button next to it.
*   **Editing a snippet:** Currently, you cannot directly edit a snippet. You will need to delete the old snippet and create a new one with your updated text.
